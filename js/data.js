    title: "Untitled (Fortune Cookie Corner) 1990",
    description:
      "Untitled (Fortune Cookie Corner) consists of a large pile of fortune cookies displayed in a corner of a room. The viewers are invited to take a cookie from the pile. The endless supply aspect of the artwork means that the pile of cookies is continuously replenished, creating an impression that the supply of cookies is never-ending. The work by Felix Gonzalez-Torres is an artwork consisting of a stack of fortune cookies. Each visitor is encouraged to take one, symbolizing the unpredictability of life, much like the uncertainty of living with AIDS. Gonzalez-Torres, a gay artist, used his art to address themes of love, loss, and mortality, often drawing connections to the AIDS epidemic that affected his community in the 1980s and 1990s.",

    title: "Untitled (Rossmore) 1992",
    description:
      "This work contains 42 lightbulbs, porcelain light sockets, and an electrical chord. Overall dimensions vary. This work by Felix Gonzalez-Torres is a poignant artwork consisting of a string of light bulbs hanging in a room. The bulbs represent the passing of time and the transient nature of life, as they gradually burn out and are replaced. Gonzalez-Torres often used everyday objects to explore themes of mortality and personal loss, and Rossmore is a somber reflection on the inevitability of change and the beauty found in the ephemeral.",

    title: "Untitled 1992/1993",
    description:
      "Untitled from 1992/1993 is a minimalist and conceptual piece that invites viewers to engage with it on multiple levels. The Endless Paper Stacks is a series of artworks by Felix Gonzalez-Torres that typically consists of stacks of identical sheets of paper placed in various settings. Viewers are invited to take a sheet, symbolizing the passing of time and the idea that art can be continuously reproduced and shared. Gonzalez-Torres used this concept to explore themes of impermanence, memory, and the power of collective experience. The stacks often reflect his personal experiences and the impact of the AIDS crisis on his community.",

    title: "Untitled (Couple) 1993",
    description:
      "Gonzalez-Torres often used simple and minimalist forms to convey complex emotions and concepts related to love and intimacy. This work has two parts, each with 24 light sockets, and electrical cords. Overall dimensions vary with installation. This work by Felix Gonzalez-Torres is a poignant artwork featuring two sets of light bulbs, each representing a couple. The bulbs symbolize the unity and connection within relationships, but also their fragility and impermanence, as they gradually fade and require replenishment. Gonzalez-Torres explored themes of love, loss, and the fleeting nature of life, often influenced by his personal experiences and the AIDS crisis.",

    title: "Untitled (Go-Go Dancing Platform) 1991",
    description:
      "This work uses wood, light bulbs, light sockets, electrical cord, and acrylic paint. This work is also a performance art piece. The Go-Go Dancing Platform is an artwork by Felix Gonzalez-Torres, featuring a raised, empty platform typically found in clubs or bars where go-go dancers perform. Gonzalez-Torres recontextualized this platform as a minimalist sculpture, devoid of dancers. It serves as a symbol of absence and longing, often linked to his personal experience of losing his partner to AIDS. The empty platform encourages viewers to contemplate themes of loss, desire, and the fleeting nature of happiness.",

    title: "Untitled (USA Today) 1990",
    description:
      "This work has an endless supply of silver, red, and blue candies. Dimensions vary with installation. This work is an artwork by Felix Gonzalez-Torres that consists of a stack of individually wrapped candies, often weighing 175 pounds. Visitors are invited to take a piece of candy, and the stack is continually replenished. The candies are wrapped in colorful, patriotic cellophane, resembling the design of the USA Today newspaper. This artwork reflects Gonzalez-Torres' interest in themes of consumption, impermanence, and the passage of time. It also engages with the concept of public participation, as viewers actively engage with and diminish the artwork over time",
